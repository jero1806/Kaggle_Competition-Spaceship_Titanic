# Kaggle_Competition-Spaceship_Titanic
This repository contains an extensive analysis for the Kaggle competition titled "Spaceship Titanic" (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), which focuses on predicting which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. The project employs Python, machine learning, and regression techniques to analyze the dataset and formulate predictions. Primary activities involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing advanced predictive models. The goal is to derive insights and forecasts that aid in securing a high position on the global leaderboard, judged by the accuracy of the predictions on the test data. This project not only seeks to rank well on the leaderboard but also aims to deeply understand the factors driving the transportation phenomenon noted in the Spaceship Titanic competition.
